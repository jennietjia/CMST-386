            <h2>How Search Engines Work</h2>
            <p>Search engine utilizes a process of crawling, indexing, and ranking to provide
                relevant results for user searches. By crawling, they use bots to discover and
                read web pages. They follow links from pages they already found or read a sitemap. 
                They index the content they find, organizing it into massive databases. When a user 
                performs a search, the engine analyzes the query and retrieves the most relevant results 
                based on algorithms that consider factors like keywords, quality, and authority.

            <h2>Importance of Keywords and Meta Tags</h2>
            <p>Keywords and descriptions, used as meta tags on a webpage, are crucial because they provide 
                search engines with a concise summary of the page's content, allowing them to better understand 
                the topic and relevance to a user's search query, ultimately impacting how the page ranks in 
                search results and encouraging clicks by providing a clear preview of what the page offers 
                to potential visitors. Well-crafted meta tags increase relevance, boost click-through rates, 
                and enhance overall SEO performance.</p>

            <h2>Four Elements for Writing Relevant Content</h2>
            <p>The four key elements that comprise writing relevant content links are relevance to the topic, 
                accurate information, natural language usage, and appropriate link placement. This ensures that 
                links are directly related to the content, provide accurate details, fit naturally within the 
                text, and are positioned where they add value to the reader, enhancing user experience and SEO.</p>

            <h2>Good Heading Hierarchy</h2>
            <p>Good heading hierarchy ensures that content is organized logically, making it easy for readers 
                and search engines to understand. The main title uses <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, followed by 
                progressively smaller headings (<code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>) for subtopics. 
                This structure provides clear navigation and improves accessibility. For example:</p>
            <section>
                <h2>Subheading 1</h2>
                <h3>Sub-subheading 1.1</h3>
                <h2>Subheading 2</h2>
                <h3>Sub-subheading 2.1</h3>
            </section>
            <p>Using a proper hierarchy enhances readability and SEO by emphasizing the importance of topics.</p>
